Rewrite
=======
Get all documentation working

New Features
============

Update the documentation's look and feel.
  More space, rounded corners etc

treeNodeContent should not need the "last" attribute - have it figure it out.
  This may mean that the rendering is defered, because it can't know if it is last till after the closing tag.
